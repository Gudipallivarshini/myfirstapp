				ADVANTAGES OF REACT JS
1.BY USING REACT JS,Single page applications
2.It compltely based on components
3.React js uses  virtual DOM
4.Code is written in jsx(javascript&xml) language
5.We can use it anywhere


DISADVANTAGES
1.More space
2.Extention js/jsx

REACT  JS COMPONENTS DIVIDED INTO 2 TYPES:
	1.Class  based components
	2.Functional based components
				before 16.3 version
1.class based componments considered  as state components 
2.Functional based components considered as stateless components
  				after 16.3 version
Functional based components are also considered as state components when the reactjs team works with 
hooks components
 if u want tosend data fromparent to child component we can use props
it is immutable
Virtualdom modifies only single component but real dom modifies total page
*Import es7 snippet should be installed if we want snippets
*RFC:React Functional based Components
*RCC:React Class based Components
